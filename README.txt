TIC TAC TOE
===========

First: Sorry, I cannot give you a complete solution of the task you offered me.
It's still WIP...

This is because after my current job's working time,
I did not have so much time for coding.
Tommorrow, I have to visit my family in Hanover, because my mom has her 70th birthday.
I'll come back in late Sunday evening...

But I think in my opinion, I can show you the following things:

- I can program in C/C++
- I know the Qt framework
- I can write unit tests
- I know CMake as well as .PRO and .PRI files
- I know Git as well as Subversion
- I know OOA and OOD

Let's speak about that what I did in an upcoming interview / meeting.
Ask me technical questions or give me please more time to finish the task.

I would be pleased, if I could start working for you!

Best Regards
Alex

P.S.:
I rewrote a part of an already existing HTTP framework which should be used
for the communication between client and server via JSON RPC.
I realized, that with the current Qt version things could be much easier...
Especially the network classes.
